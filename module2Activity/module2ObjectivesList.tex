\maketitle

In this homework, we will review the properties and how to construct linear functions. We will also review solving linear equations in preparation for solving more difficult types of equations later. The objectives for this homework are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:62_eXnY6@14/Linear-Equations-in-One-Variable}{Construct linear functions with a slope and point or with two points.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:62_eXnY6@14/Linear-Equations-in-One-Variable}{Convert a linear function between slope-intercept form and Standard form.}
	\item \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:62_eXnY6@14/Linear-Equations-in-One-Variable}{Convert between a linear equation and the graph of a linear equation.} \href{https://cnx.org/contents/mwjClAV_@8.1:62_eXnY6@14/Linear-Equations-in-One-Variable}{Solve linear equations.}
\end{enumerate}
